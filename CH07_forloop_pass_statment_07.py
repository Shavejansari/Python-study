#The Pass Statement
'''
Pass is a null statement in python.
It instructs to "Do nothing"

Ex:
    l = [1, 7, 8]
    for item in l:
        pass              ====> Without pss, the program will throw an error


'''

i = 4
if i>0:
    pass
while i>6:
    pass
print("I want to become director of zapbuild")
