#Range function in Python
'''The range function in python is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
for i in range(8):
    print(i)

we can also specify start, stop and step-size as follows:

            range(start, stop, stepsize)
                                    |---->step size is usally not used with range()
for i in range(0, 7):     -->range(7) can be used
    print(i)              -->prints 0 to 6
    
'''

for i in range(8, 16, 2):
    print(i)
